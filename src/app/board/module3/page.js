          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            I hope you are well. I am writing to inform you about an important
            matter that requires our immediate attention. Earlier this morning,
            our company, HPBM AG, has received a friendly takeover letter from
            WHSE Inc. Given the significance of this development, I propose two
            consecutive extraordinary meetings to thoroughly discuss and address
            this situation.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            I propose the first meeting on 12 April 2024, from 08.00 to 11.00.
            This meeting will allow all directors to review the details of the
            takeover letter, its implications, and the potential opportunities
            and risks associated with such an offer. The primary objective of
            this meeting is to raise pertinent questions regarding the takeover
            offer, which will be addressed to the company's leadership team.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            I suggest a second meeting on 16 April 2024 (08:00-12:00). During
            this meeting, our CEO and CFO will join at the beginning to address
            the questions raised in the first meeting and convey the leadership
            team's opinion on the takeover offer. Their insights and guidance
            will be valuable as we collectively deliberate on the best course of
            action for our company. In this second meeting, it is crucial that
            we engage in a comprehensive and open discussion to formulate our
            response strategy, which aligns with our companyâ€™s best interests.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            I kindly request alldirectors to thoroughly review the takeover
            letter and any relevant supporting materials prior to the meetings.
            Please come prepared to share your perspectives, insights, and
            recommendations.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            Given the urgency and significance of this situation, it is crucial
            that we prioritize attendance and ensure all directors are available
            for these extraordinary meetings. Please confirm your availability
            promptly by replying to this email, including any scheduling
            conflicts you may have.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            I believe that by promptly addressing this issue and working
            collaboratively, we can navigate this potential takeover situation
            in the best interests of our company and its stakeholders. I greatly
            appreciate your commitment and dedication to the success of HPBM AG.

            I hope this message finds you well. Today, in the midst of delicate
            takeover proceedings, I received an anonymous whistleblower email
            regarding the CEO, implying potential personal misconduct with a
            member of the CEO's office (an intern). I have attached the email
            for your review.

            urgently. We have an already scheduled meeting in two days, and
            during the second half, where the CEO and CFO won't participate, I
            propose allocating time to discuss and address this issue
            collectively.

            I hope this email reaches you under the strictest confidence. I
            regret to inform you that the CEO of HPBM is behaving in a way that

            This past weekend I happened to see his yacht pull into the port of
            Barcelona. At the time I was having a lunch with my friends. The
            restaurant was located next to the Marina, about 50 m from where the
            yacht docked.

            To my surprise, the only other passenger on board was Miss Maria D.,
            a 24-year old trainee who joined our company a year ago after
            completing her bachelorâ€™s degree in marketing. Miss D. is currently
            participating in our HIPO program. As part of this program, she was
            assigned to the CEOâ€™s office six months ago. She is the first and
            only trainee in the program's eight-year history to be assigned to
            the CEO.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            I also want to point out that Miss. D. financed her university

            I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am
            writing to you today as the CEO, President, and Chair of WHSE Inc.,
            a leading US-based company in the automotive industry. Our company
            has been highly successful in providing cutting-edge solutions and
            delivering value to our customers worldwide.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            I am pleased to inform you that WHSE Inc. has formulated a
            well-considered proposal for the acquisition of the entire share
            capital of HPBM AG. Our offer represents a significant opportunity
            for both WHSE Inc. and HPBM AG to combine our strengths, expand our
            market presence, and create enhanced value for our stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            The terms of our all-cash takeover offer reflect our deep
            appreciation for the value and potential of HPBM AG. We are pleased
            to propose a premium of 20% based on the 30-day volume weighted
            average closing price of HPBM. This premium demonstrates our
            commitment to recognizing and valuing the hard work and achievements
            of HPBM AG's management, employees, and shareholders.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            I would like to emphasize that WHSE Inc. is genuinely interested in
            fostering a collaborative and constructive relationship with HPBM
            AG's management throughout the acquisition process. We believe it is
            crucial to engage in open and transparent discussions to explore the
            feasibility of this combination and ensure the long-term success of
            our joint venture.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            Moreover, I am pleased to inform you that the financing required for
            this transaction has already been secured. Our financial strength,
            combined with our extensive industry expertise, positions us
            favorably to support HPBM AG's growth aspirations and realize our
            shared vision.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            Upon a successful acquisition, WHSE Inc. intends to merge HPBM AG
            with our renowned division, LightStar Inc. This strategic
            integration will leverage the strengths of both organizations,
            capitalize on synergies, and drive sustainable growth in the global
            auto components market.

          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            To proceed with the next steps, I propose scheduling a meeting at a

            WHSE Inc.'s subsidiaries, including Lightstar International Inc. and
            AutoSense Inc., are key players in the automotive sector. Lightstar

            acquisitions, primarily on a smaller scale. However, some industry
            observers have raised questions regarding the effectiveness of WHSE
            Inc.'s acquisition strategy and its ability to seamlessly integrate
            acquired companies.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            Notably, WHSE Inc. made two significant acquisitions in the
            automotive industry, each surpassing the $1 billion mark in value.
            Unfortunately, these acquisitions did not yield the anticipated
            results, prompting discussions about the company's integration
            capabilities. WHSE Inc. remains committed to driving growth and
            fostering innovation across its operating segments.

          <h2>Lightstar</h2>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            Lghstar International Inc., a prominent lighting solutions company
            headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, specializes in providing
            cutting-edge intelligent lighting solutions for the automotive
            industry. With a strong focus on this sector, the company operates
            two manufacturing plants in the United States, with one situated in
            Detroit and the other in Tennessee. Approximately 38% of Lighstar's
            revenues are generated from the North American market.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            In addition to its operations in North America, Lighstar Inc. has
            strategically expanded its reach in Latin America with production
            plants in Mexico and Brazil. Furthermore, Lighstar operates a
            manufacturing facility in the Czech Republic in Europe, further
            solidifying its commitment to providing lighting solutions for the
            automotive sector on a global scale. Additionally, the company's
            innovation center near Stuttgart, Germany, drives research and
            development efforts in Europe to stay at the forefront of
            intelligent lighting technology in the automotiveindustry.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            Lightstar has a limited presence in Asia. In 2015, Lightstar opened
            its first manufacturing plant in Indonesia as part of its efforts to
            tap into the growing Asian market. This facility serves as a
            strategic base for the company to meet the demand for its lighting
            solutions in the region. In 2018, Lighstar established an innovation
            center in Singapore. In the last fiscal year, Asia accounted for
            approximately 13% of Lightstar's global revenues.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            Lightstar has encountered several challenges in recent times.
            Firstly, the company has faced mounting pressure from
            well-established players in its key markets. Furthermore, the
            automotive lighting industry is witnessing a transformative trend
            towards intelligent, efficient, environmentally friendly, and
            personalized lighting solutions. This shift in customer preferences
            has created a growing demand for innovative, high-quality, and
            visually appealing lighting solutions, encompassing both exterior
            beams and interior applications.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            Lightstar has, in general, not been widely acknowledged as a
            technological leader with premium products. Despite recent efforts,
            the company has faced challenges in successfully reorienting itself
            towards the premium segments that require more sophisticated and
            advanced solutions. European manufacturers currently dominate these
            segments.
          </p>
          <p className="body-default-16 mb-5">
            The global automotive lighting market is projected to experience
            substantial growth, with an estimated increase from USD 21.9 billion
            in 2022 to USD 28.5 billion in 2027, reflecting a compound annual
            growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% (Source: Markets & Markets 2023)). The
            increasing demand for premium vehicles is expected to be a
            significant driver for the growth of advanced lighting systems in
            the automotive industry. Customers seeking premium vehicles
            increasingly prioritize advanced lighting features that offer
            improved aesthetics, functionality, and energy efficiency.
